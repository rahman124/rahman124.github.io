      <description>In this blog post I will show you how you can send your emails from Exim to Office 365 via a TLS connector.
I will discuss the steps that I took to configure this in our environment so that you may have an easier time if you decide to go down the same route aswell. Prerequisites In the Exchange admin center, you will need to have your TLS certificate domain configured as an accepted domain in your Office 365 organisation.</description>
